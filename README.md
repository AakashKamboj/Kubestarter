Kubernetes Concepts Covered in this Repository:
Core Kubernetes Components & Architecture
Kubernetes Architecture - Control Plane, Worker Nodes, etcd, API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager
Pods - NGINX Example - Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
Services - NGINX Example - Network abstraction for accessing Pods
Deployments - NGINX Example - Declarative updates and lifecycle management for Pods
Namespaces - Virtual clusters for resource isolation and organization
Workload Controllers
DaemonSet - Examples - Ensures pods run on all/selected nodes
Configuration & Secrets Management
ConfigMaps - MySQL Example - Non-confidential configuration data
Secrets - MySQL Example - Sensitive information like passwords
Storage & Persistence
Persistent Volumes (PV) - Examples - Cluster-wide storage resources
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) - Examples - Storage requests by users
Volume Mounts - MySQL Example - Attaching storage to containers
Networking & Traffic Management
Ingress - Examples - HTTP/HTTPS traffic routing and load balancing
Ingress Controllers - Setup Guide - Implementation of Ingress rules
Auto-scaling & Resource Management
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) - Examples - Automatic scaling based on CPU/memory
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) - Examples - Automatic resource adjustment
Resource Requests & Limits - HPA Example - CPU and memory constraints
Security & Access Control
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Examples - Fine-grained permissions
Roles & RoleBindings - Examples - Namespace-scoped permissions
Service Accounts - Examples - Identity for pods and processes
Node Management & Scheduling
